# RxJavaFX: JavaFX bindings for RxJava

This is a fork of the original repository of [RxJavaFX](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxJavaFX).

It's a follow up on [this comment](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxJavaFX/pull/94#issuecomment-908499509) and it's the minimal work needed to make it up and running using [RxJava](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxJava) version 3.x. As per the comment, the library has been repackaged on a different domain and released to Maven Central.

This library is released for our needs and to be easily available to our products, you can use it but don't expect any active maintenance.

A PDF version of the guide written by the original author is available [here](src/docs/rxjavafx-guide.pdf) given the original link is now dead.

It requires **JDK 11**

Maven:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.pdfsam.rxjava3</groupId>
    <artifactId>rxjavafx</artifactId>
    <version>3.x.y</version>
</dependency>
```
